## About Githyanki

Githyanki is a starter theme for Statamic 3


## Warning

Unless you know what you're doing there's probably no reason to use this starter kit. Why? Because I don't really know 
what __I'm__ doing. This is for me to learn about Statamic 3 and to use as a starter kit for my projects. That said, 
I hope this will be of use to someone one day.
