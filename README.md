## About Githyanki

Githyanki is a starter theme for Statamic 3


## Warning

Unless you know what you're doing there's probably no reason to use this starter kit. Why? Because I don't really know 
what __I'm__ doing. This is for me to learn about Statamic 3 and to use as a starter kit for my projects. Though you are
welcome to use it or check it out if you'd like. And any feedback is appreciated. That said, I hope this will be of use
to someone one day.
